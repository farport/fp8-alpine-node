# fp8-alpine-node

Simple extension of `node:X.Y.Z-alpine` that sets and exposes yarn cache directory.

## Version

#### Version: 8.14.0

* Base Image:   `node:8.14.0-alpine`
* Yarn Version: `1.12.3`

### Version Convention

The objective of this docker image is to pair the version of node and yarn.  As result,
the tag used will be based on the version of alpine image used.  Assuming that `node:X.Y.Z-alpine`
is used as based image, the version for this docker image will be:

* `fp8-alpine-node:X.Y.n`

Where `n` is the build number of `fp8-alpine-node` project.

   requires python.  The dependecies are `make gcc g++ python`  
1. `git`: some packages has git based dependencies so `git` is needs to be added to make
   those packages work.  E.g.: [websocket:1.0.28](https://github.com/theturtle32/WebSocket-Node/blob/v1.0.28/package.json)
